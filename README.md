This repo is a collection of changes made to existing researcg code. We ran machine learning algos (like LDA) on the code from https://github.com/MultiScale-BCI/IV-2a 
(associated research paper: Fast and Accurate Multiclass Inference for MI-BCIs Using Large Multiscale Temporal and Spectral Features). 

We are grateful to researcher Michael Hersche, and student TAs Anika Rajamani and Emma Jin for their guidance.
